# YouTube-Landing-Page-Clone-Using-HTML-CSS
This project consists of a YouTube main page created entirely from scratch using HTML and CSS. The main page replicates the familiar layout and design of the YouTube platform, showcasing the use of HTML for content structuring and CSS for styling. 
While this project primarily serves as an practice exercise and showcases basic HTML and CSS usage, contributions are welcome.

**Usage**
To begin, clone the repository onto your local computer. Then, within Visual Studio Code, ensure you have the necessary extensions installed to support HTML and CSS development. Specifically, make sure you have the "Live Server" extension installed. 

Once these extensions are in place, navigate to the repository's directory using Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal. Locate the `youtube.html` file and right-click on it. From the context menu, select the "Open with Live Server" option. This will initiate a local server that hosts the page.

By doing so, you'll be able to instantly view the YouTube main page by simply launching it through the Live Server extension. This method provides an efficient way to interact with and test the page's layout and design in a live environment.
